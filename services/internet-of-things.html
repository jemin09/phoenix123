        <b>Home automation</b><br><br>

        <p>IoT devices are a part of the larger concept of home automation, which can include lighting, heating and
          air
          conditioning, media and security systems and camera systems.Long-term benefits could include energy savings
          by
          automatically ensuring lights and electronics are turned off or by making the residents in the home aware of
          usage.</p>
        <p>A smart home or automated home could be based on a platform or hubs that control smart devices and
          appliances.For instance, using Apple's HomeKit, manufacturers can have their home products and accessories
          controlled by an application in iOS devices such as the iPhone and the Apple Watch.This could be a dedicated
          app or iOS native applications such as Siri.This can be demonstrated in the case of Lenovo's Smart Home
          Essentials, which is a line of smart home devices that are controlled through Apple's Home app or Siri without
          the need for a Wi-Fi bridge.There are also dedicated smart home hubs that are offered as standalone platforms
          to connect different smart home products and these include the Amazon Echo, Google Home, Apple's HomePod, and
          Samsung's SmartThings Hub.In addition to the commercial systems, there are many non-proprietary, open source
          ecosystems; including Home Assistant, OpenHAB and Domoticz.</p>
        <p>
          One key application of a smart home is to provide assistance to elderly individuals and to those with
          disabilities. These home systems use assistive technology to accommodate an owner's specific
          disabilities.Voice control can assist users with sight and mobility limitations while alert systems can be
          connected directly to cochlear implants worn by hearing-impaired users.They can also be equipped with
          additional safety features, including sensors that monitor for medical emergencies such as falls or
          seizures.Smart home technology applied in this way can provide users with more freedom and a higher quality of
          life.
        </p>
        <p>
          IoT devices can be used to monitor and control the mechanical, electrical and electronic systems used in
          various types of buildings (e.g., public and private, industrial, institutions, or residential) in home
          automation and building automation systems. In this context, three main areas are being covered in literature:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>The integration of the Internet with building energy management systems to create energy-efficient and
            IOT-driven "smart buildings".</li><br>
          <li>The possible means of real-time monitoring for reducing energy consumption and monitoring occupant
            behaviors.</li><br>
          <li>The integration of smart devices in the built environment and how they might be used in future
            applications.</li><br>
        </ul>
        <b>Medical and healthcare</b><br><br>
        <p>The <b>Internet of Medical Things (IoMT)</b> is an application of the IoT for medical and health-related
          purposes, data collection and analysis for research, and monitoring.The IoMT has been referenced as "Smart
          Healthcare",as the technology for creating a digitized healthcare system, connecting available medical
          resources and healthcare services.</p>
        <p>IoT devices can be used to enable remote health monitoring and emergency notification systems. These health
          monitoring devices can range from blood pressure and heart rate monitors to advanced devices capable of
          monitoring specialized implants, such as pacemakers, Fitbit electronic wristbands, or advanced hearing
          aids.Some hospitals have begun implementing "smart beds" that can detect when they are occupied and when a
          patient is attempting to get up. It can also adjust itself to ensure appropriate pressure and support are
          applied to the patient without the manual interaction of nurses.A 2015 Goldman Sachs report indicated that
          healthcare IoT devices "can save the United States more than $300 billion in annual healthcare expenditures by
          increasing revenue and decreasing cost." Moreover, the use of mobile devices to support medical follow-up led
          to the creation of 'm-health', used analyzed health statistics."</p>
        <p>Specialized sensors can also be equipped within living spaces to monitor the health and general well-being of
          senior citizens, while also ensuring that proper treatment is being administered and assisting people to
          regain lost mobility via therapy as well.These sensors create a network of intelligent sensors that are able
          to collect, process, transfer, and analyze valuable information in different environments, such as connecting
          in-home monitoring devices to hospital-based systems.Other consumer devices to encourage healthy living, such
          as connected scales or wearable heart monitors, are also a possibility with the IoT.End-to-end health
          monitoring IoT platforms are also available for antenatal and chronic patients, helping one manage health
          vitals and recurring medication requirements.</p>
        <p>Advances in plastic and fabric electronics fabrication methods have enabled ultra-low cost, use-and-throw
          IoMT sensors. These sensors, along with the required RFID electronics, can be fabricated on paper or
          e-textiles for wireless powered disposable sensing devices.Applications have been established for
          point-of-care medical diagnostics, where portability and low system-complexity is essential.</p>
        <p>As of 2018 IoMT was not only being applied in the clinical laboratory industry,but also in the healthcare and
          health insurance industries. IoMT in the healthcare industry is now permitting doctors, patients, and others,
          such as guardians of patients, nurses, families, and similar, to be part of a system, where patient records
          are saved in a database, allowing doctors and the rest of the medical staff to have access to patient
          information.IoMT in the insurance industry provides access to better and new types of dynamic information.
          This includes sensor-based solutions such as biosensors, wearables, connected health devices, and mobile apps
          to track customer behavior. This can lead to more accurate underwriting and new pricing models.</p>
        <p>The application of the IoT in healthcare plays a fundamental role in managing chronic diseases and in disease
          prevention and control. Remote monitoring is made possible through the connection of powerful wireless
          solutions. The connectivity enables health practitioners to capture patient's data and apply complex
          algorithms in health data analysis.</p>
        <b>Transportation</b><br><br>
        <p>The IoT can assist in the integration of communications, control, and information processing across various
          transportation systems. Application of the IoT extends to all aspects of transportation systems (i.e., the
          vehicle,the infrastructure, and the driver or user). Dynamic interaction between these components of a
          transport system enables inter- and intra-vehicular communication,smart traffic control, smart parking,
          electronic toll collection systems, logistics and fleet management, vehicle control, safety, and road
          assistance.</p>
        <b>Manufacturing</b><br><br>
        <p>The IoT can connect various manufacturing devices equipped with sensing, identification, processing,
          communication, actuation, and networking capabilities. Network control and management of manufacturing
          equipment, asset and situation management, or manufacturing process control allow IoT to be used for
          industrial applications and smart manufacturing.IoT intelligent systems enable rapid manufacturing and
          optimization of new products and rapid response to product demands.</p>
        <p>Digital control systems to automate process controls, operator tools and service information systems to
          optimize plant safety and security are within the purview of the IIoT. IoT can also be applied to asset
          management via predictive maintenance, statistical evaluation, and measurements to maximize reliability.
          Industrial management systems can be integrated with smart grids, enabling energy optimization. Measurements,
          automated controls, plant optimization, health and safety management, and other functions are provided by
          networked sensors.</p>
        <p>In addition to general manufacturing, IoT is also used for processes in the industrialization of
          construction.</p>
        <b>Agriculture</b><br><br>
        <p>There are numerous IoT applications in farming such as collecting data on temperature, rainfall, humidity,
          wind speed, pest infestation, and soil content. This data can be used to automate farming techniques, take
          informed decisions to improve quality and quantity, minimize risk and waste, and reduce the effort required to
          manage crops. For example, farmers can now monitor soil temperature and moisture from afar and even apply
          IoT-acquired data to precision fertilization programs.The overall goal is that data from sensors, coupled with
          the farmer's knowledge and intuition about his or her farm, can help increase farm productivity, and also help
          reduce costs.</p>
        <p>In August 2018, Toyota Tsusho began a partnership with Microsoft to create fish farming tools using the
          Microsoft Azure application suite for IoT technologies related to water management. Developed in part by
          researchers from Kindai University, the water pump mechanisms use artificial intelligence to count the number
          of fish on a conveyor belt, analyze the number of fish, and deduce the effectiveness of water flow from the
          data the fish provide.The FarmBeats project from Microsoft Research that uses TV white space to connect farms
          is also a part of the Azure Marketplace now.</p>
        <b>Military</b><br><br>
        <p>The Internet of Military Things (IoMT) is the application of IoT technologies in the military domain for the
          purposes of reconnaissance, surveillance, and other combat-related objectives. It is heavily influenced by the
          future prospects of warfare in an urban environment and involves the use of sensors, munitions, vehicles,
          robots, human-wearable biometrics, and other smart technology that is relevant on the battlefield.</p>
        <p>One of the examples of IOT devices used in the military is Xaver 1000 system. The Xaver 1000 was developed by
          Israel's Camero Tech, which is the latest in the company's line of "through wall imaging systems". The Xaver
          line uses millimeter wave (MMW) radar, or radar in the range of 30-300 gigahertz. It is equipped with an
          AI-based life target tracking system as well as its own 3D 'sense-through-the-wall' technology.</p>
        <b>Internet of Battlefield Things </b><br><br>
        <p>The <b>Internet of Battlefield Things (IoBT)</b> is a project initiated and executed by the U.S. Army
          Research Laboratory (ARL) that focuses on the basic science related to the IoT that enhance the capabilities
          of Army soldiers.In 2017, ARL launched the Internet of Battlefield Things Collaborative Research Alliance
          (IoBT-CRA), establishing a working collaboration between industry, university, and Army researchers to advance
          the theoretical foundations of IoT technologies and their applications to Army operations.</p>
        <b>Ocean of Things</b>
        <br>
        <p>The <b>Ocean of Things</b> project is a DARPA-led program designed to establish an Internet of things across
          large ocean areas for the purposes of collecting, monitoring, and analyzing environmental and vessel activity
          data. The project entails the deployment of about 50,000 floats that house a passive sensor suite that
          autonomously detect and track military and commercial vessels as part of a cloud-based network.</p>
        <b>Product digitalization </b>
        <br>
        <p>There are several applications of smart or active packaging in which a QR code or NFC tag is affixed on a
          product or its packaging. The tag itself is passive, however, it contains a unique identifier (typically a
          URL) which enables a user to access digital content about the product via a smartphone.Strictly speaking, such
          passive items are not part of the Internet of things, but they can be seen as enablers of digital
          interactions.The term "Internet of Packaging" has been coined to describe applications in which unique
          identifiers are used, to automate supply chains, and are scanned on large scale by consumers to access digital
          content. Authentication of the unique identifiers, and thereby of the product itself, is possible via a
          copy-sensitive digital watermark or copy detection pattern for scanning when scanning a QR code, while NFC
          tags can encrypt communication.

          Our Mechanical engineers research, design, develop, build, and test mechanical and thermal devices, including
          tools, engines, and machines.
        </p>
        <p>Mechanical engineers typically do the following:

        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Analyze problems to see how mechanical and thermal devices might help solve the problem.</li>
          <li>Design or redesign mechanical and thermal devices using analysis and computer-aided design.</li>
          <li>Develop and test prototypes of devices they design.</li>
          <li>Analyze the test results and change the design as needed.</li>
          <li>Oversee the manufacturing process for the device.

          </li>
          <li>Manage a team of professionals in specialized fields like mechanical drafting and designing, prototyping,
            3D printing or/and CNC Machines specialists.

        <p>The field of mechanical engineering can be thought of as a collection of many mechanical engineering science
          disciplines. Several of these subdisciplines which are typically taught at the undergraduate level are listed
          below, with a brief explanation and the most common application of each. Some of these subdisciplines are
          unique to mechanical engineering, while others are a combination of mechanical engineering and one or more
          other disciplines. Most work that a mechanical engineer does uses skills and techniques from several of these
          subdisciplines, as well as specialized subdisciplines. Specialized subdisciplines, as used in this article,
          are more likely to be the subject of graduate studies or on-the-job training than undergraduate research.
          Several specialized subdisciplines are discussed in this section.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p><b>Mechanics</b>
        </p>
        <p>Mechanics is, in the most general sense, the study of forces and their effect upon matter. Typically,
          engineering mechanics is used to analyze and predict the acceleration and deformation (both elastic and
          plastic) of objects under known forces (also called loads) or stresses. Subdisciplines of mechanics include
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Statics, the study of non-moving bodies under known loads, how forces affect static bodies</li>
          <li>Dynamics the study of how forces affect moving bodies. Dynamics includes kinematics (about movement,
            velocity, and acceleration) and kinetics (about forces and resulting accelerations).
          </li>
          <li>Mechanics of materials, the study of how different materials deform under various types of stress</li>
          <li>Fluid mechanics, the study of how fluids react to forces.

          </li>
          <li>Kinematics, the study of the motion of bodies (objects) and systems (groups of objects), while ignoring
            the forces that cause the motion. Kinematics is often used in the design and analysis of mechanisms.
          </li>
          <li>Continuum mechanics, a method of applying mechanics that assumes that objects are continuous (rather than
            discrete)

          </li>

        </ul>
        <p>Mechanical engineers typically use mechanics in the design or analysis phases of engineering. If the
          engineering project were the design of a vehicle, statics might be employed to design the frame of the
          vehicle, in order to evaluate where the stresses will be most intense. Dynamics might be used when designing
          the car's engine, to evaluate the forces in the pistons and cams as the engine cycles. Mechanics of materials
          might be used to choose appropriate materials for the frame and engine. Fluid mechanics might be used to
          design a ventilation system for the vehicle (see HVAC), or to design the intake system for the engine.


        </p>
        <br>
        <b>Mechatronics and robotics
        </b>
        <p>Mechatronics is a combination of mechanics and electronics. It is an interdisciplinary branch of mechanical
          engineering, electrical engineering and software engineering that is concerned with integrating electrical and
          mechanical engineering to create hybrid automation systems. In this way, machines can be automated through the
          use of electric motors, servo-mechanisms, and other electrical systems in conjunction with special software. A
          common example of a mechatronics system is a CD-ROM drive. Mechanical systems open and close the drive, spin
          the CD and move the laser, while an optical system reads the data on the CD and converts it to bits.
          Integrated software controls the process and communicates the contents of the CD to the computer.
        </p>
        <p>Robotics is the application of mechatronics to create robots, which are often used in industry to perform
          tasks that are dangerous, unpleasant, or repetitive. These robots may be of any shape and size, but all are
          preprogrammed and interact physically with the world. To create a robot, an engineer typically employs
          kinematics (to determine the robot's range of motion) and mechanics (to determine the stresses within the
          robot).</p>
        <p>Robots are used extensively in industrial automation engineering. They allow businesses to save money on
          labor, perform tasks that are either too dangerous or too precise for humans to perform them economically, and
          to ensure better quality. Many companies employ assembly lines of robots, especially in Automotive Industries
          and some factories are so robotized that they can run by themselves. Outside the factory, robots have been
          employed in bomb disposal, space exploration, and many other fields. Robots are also sold for various
          residential applications, from recreation to domestic applications.

        </p>
        <br>
        <b>Structural analysis
        </b>
        <p>Structural analysis is the branch of mechanical engineering (and also civil engineering) devoted to examining
          why and how objects fail and to fix the objects and their performance. Structural failures occur in two
          general modes: static failure, and fatigue failure. Static structural failure occurs when, upon being loaded
          (having a force applied) the object being analyzed either breaks or is deformed plastically, depending on the
          criterion for failure. Fatigue failure occurs when an object fails after a number of repeated loading and
          unloading cycles. Fatigue failure occurs because of imperfections in the object: a microscopic crack on the
          surface of the object, for instance, will grow slightly with each cycle (propagation) until the crack is large
          enough to cause ultimate failure.

        </p>
        <p>Failure is not simply defined as when a part breaks, however; it is defined as when a part does not operate
          as intended. Some systems, such as the perforated top sections of some plastic bags, are designed to break. If
          these systems do not break, failure analysis might be employed to determine the cause.

        </p>
        <p>Structural analysis is often used by mechanical engineers after a failure has occurred, or when designing to
          prevent failure. Engineers often use online documents and books such as those published by ASM to aid them in
          determining the type of failure and possible causes.

        </p>
        <p>Once theory is applied to a mechanical design, physical testing is often performed to verify calculated
          results. Structural analysis may be used in an office when designing parts, in the field to analyze failed
          parts, or in laboratories where parts might undergo controlled failure tests.

        </p>
        <b>Thermodynamics and thermo-science
        </b>
        <p>Thermodynamics is an applied science used in several branches of engineering, including mechanical and
          chemical engineering. At its simplest, thermodynamics is the study of energy, its use and transformation
          through a system. Typically, engineering thermodynamics is concerned with changing energy from one form to
          another. As an example, automotive engines convert chemical energy (enthalpy) from the fuel into heat, and
          then into mechanical work that eventually turns the wheels.

        </p>
        <p>Thermodynamics principles are used by mechanical engineers in the fields of heat transfer, thermofluids, and
          energy conversion. Mechanical engineers use thermo-science to design engines and power plants, heating,
          ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems, heat exchangers, heat sinks, radiators, refrigeration,
          insulation, and others.

        </p>
        <br>
        <b>Design and drafting
        </b>
        <p>
          Drafting or technical drawing is the means by which mechanical engineers design products and create
          instructions for manufacturing parts. A technical drawing can be a computer model or hand-drawn schematic
          showing all the dimensions necessary to manufacture a part, as well as assembly notes, a list of required
          materials, and other pertinent information. A U.S. mechanical engineer or skilled worker who creates technical
          drawings may be referred to as a drafter or draftsman. Drafting has historically been a two-dimensional
          process, but computer-aided design (CAD) programs now allow the designer to create in three dimensions.


        </p>
        <p>Instructions for manufacturing a part must be fed to the necessary machinery, either manually, through
          programmed instructions, or through the use of a computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) or combined CAD/CAM
          program. Optionally, an engineer may also manually manufacture a part using the technical drawings. However,
          with the advent of computer numerically controlled (CNC) manufacturing, parts can now be fabricated without
          the need for constant technician input. Manually manufactured parts generally consist of spray coatings,
          surface finishes, and other processes that cannot economically or practically be done by a machine.

        </p>
        <p>Drafting is used in nearly every subdiscipline of mechanical engineering, and by many other branches of
          engineering and architecture. Three-dimensional models created using CAD software are also commonly used in
          finite element analysis (FEA) and computational fluid dynamics (CFD).

        <h2>
          Modern tools
        </h2>
      </div>
      <div class="content" style="text-align: left;color: black; ">
        <p>Many mechanical engineering companies, especially those in industrialized nations, have begun to incorporate computer-aided engineering (CAE) programs into their existing design and analysis processes, including 2D and 3D solid modeling computer-aided design (CAD). This method has many benefits, including easier and more exhaustive visualization of products, the ability to create virtual assemblies of parts, and the ease of use in designing mating interfaces and tolerances.

        </p>
        <p>Other CAE programs commonly used by mechanical engineers include product lifecycle management (PLM) tools and analysis tools used to perform complex simulations. Analysis tools may be used to predict product response to expected loads, including fatigue life and manufacturability. These tools include finite element analysis (FEA), computational fluid dynamics (CFD), and computer-aided manufacturing (CAM).

        </p>
        <p>Using CAE programs, a mechanical design team can quickly and cheaply iterate the design process to develop a product that better meets cost, performance, and other constraints. No physical prototype need be created until the design nears completion, allowing hundreds or thousands of designs to be evaluated, instead of a relative few. In addition, CAE analysis programs can model complicated physical phenomena which cannot be solved by hand, such as viscoelasticity, complex contact between mating parts, or non-Newtonian flows.

        </p>
        <p>As mechanical engineering begins to merge with other disciplines, as seen in mechatronics, multidisciplinary design optimization (MDO) is being used with other CAE programs to automate and improve the iterative design process. MDO tools wrap around existing CAE processes, allowing product evaluation to continue even after the analyst goes home for the day. They also use sophisticated optimization algorithms to more intelligently explore possible designs, often finding better, innovative solutions to difficult multidisciplinary design problems.

        <p>Mechanical engineers are constantly pushing the boundaries of what is physically possible in order to produce safer, cheaper, and more efficient machines and mechanical systems. Some technologies at the cutting edge of mechanical engineering are listed below.

        </p>
        <br>
        <b>Micro electro-mechanical systems (MEMS)
        </b>
<p>Micron-scale mechanical components such as springs, gears, fluidic and heat transfer devices are fabricated from a variety of substrate materials such as silicon, glass and polymers like SU8. Examples of MEMS components are the accelerometers that are used as car airbag sensors, modern cell phones, gyroscopes for precise positioning and microfluidic devices used in biomedical applications.

</p>
       <br>
       <b>Friction stir welding (FSW)
      </b>
       <p>Friction stir welding, a new type of welding, was discovered in 1991 by The Welding Institute (TWI). The innovative steady state (non-fusion) welding technique joins materials previously un-weldable, including several aluminum alloys. It plays an important role in the future construction of airplanes, potentially replacing rivets. Current uses of this technology to date include welding the seams of the aluminum main Space Shuttle external tank, Orion Crew Vehicle, Boeing Delta II and Delta IV Expendable Launch Vehicles and the SpaceX Falcon 1 rocket, armor plating for amphibious assault ships, and welding the wings and fuselage panels of the new Eclipse 500 aircraft from Eclipse Aviation among an increasingly growing pool of uses.

       </p>
       <br>
       <b>Composites</b>
       <p>Composites or composite materials are a combination of materials which provide different physical characteristics than either material separately. Composite material research within mechanical engineering typically focuses on designing (and, subsequently, finding applications for) stronger or more rigid materials while attempting to reduce weight, susceptibility to corrosion, and other undesirable factors. Carbon fiber reinforced composites, for instance, have been used in such diverse applications as spacecraft and fishing rods.

       </p>
       <br>
       <b>Mechatronics
      </b>
      <p>Mechatronics is the synergistic combination of mechanical engineering, electronic engineering, and software engineering. The discipline of mechatronics began as a way to combine mechanical principles with electrical engineering. Mechatronic concepts are used in the majority of electro-mechanical systems.Typical electro-mechanical sensors used in mechatronics are strain gauges, thermocouples, and pressure transducers.

      </p>
      <br>
      <b>Nanotechnology
      </b>
      <p>At the smallest scales, mechanical engineering becomes nanotechnology—one speculative goal of which is to create a molecular assembler to build molecules and materials via mechanosynthesis. For now that goal remains within exploratory engineering. Areas of current mechanical engineering research in nanotechnology include nanofilters, nanofilms, and nanostructures, among others.

      </p>
      <b>Finite element analysis
      </b>
      <p>Finite Element Analysis is a computational tool used to estimate stress, strain, and deflection of solid bodies. It uses a mesh setup with user-defined sizes to measure physical quantities at a node. The more nodes there are, the higher the precision. This field is not new, as the basis of Finite Element Analysis (FEA) or Finite Element Method (FEM) dates back to 1941. But the evolution of computers has made FEA/FEM a viable option for analysis of structural problems. Many commercial codes such as NASTRAN, ANSYS, and ABAQUS are widely used in industry for research and the design of components. Some 3D modeling and CAD software packages have added FEA modules. In the recent times, cloud simulation platforms like SimScale are becoming more common.

      </p>
      <p>Other techniques such as finite difference method (FDM) and finite-volume method (FVM) are employed to solve problems relating heat and mass transfer, fluid flows, fluid surface interaction, etc.

      </p>
      <br>
      <b>Biomechanics</b>
      <p>Biomechanics is the application of mechanical principles to biological systems, such as humans, animals, plants, organs, and cells. Biomechanics also aids in creating prosthetic limbs and artificial organs for humans. Biomechanics is closely related to engineering, because it often uses traditional engineering sciences to analyze biological systems. Some simple applications of Newtonian mechanics and/or materials sciences can supply correct approximations to the mechanics of many biological systems.

      </p>
      <p>In the past decade, reverse engineering of materials found in nature such as bone matter has gained funding in academia. The structure of bone matter is optimized for its purpose of bearing a large amount of compressive stress per unit weight. The goal is to replace crude steel with bio-material for structural design.

      </p>
      <p>Over the past decade the Finite element method (FEM) has also entered the Biomedical sector highlighting further engineering aspects of Biomechanics. FEM has since then established itself as an alternative to in vivo surgical assessment and gained the wide acceptance of academia. The main advantage of Computational Biomechanics lies in its ability to determine the endo-anatomical response of an anatomy, without being subject to ethical restrictions.This has led FE modelling to the point of becoming ubiquitous in several fields of Biomechanics while several projects have even adopted an open source philosophy (e.g. BioSpine).

      </p>
      <br>
      <b>Computational fluid dynamics
      </b>
      <p>Computational fluid dynamics, usually abbreviated as CFD, is a branch of fluid mechanics that uses numerical methods and algorithms to solve and analyze problems that involve fluid flows. Computers are used to perform the calculations required to simulate the interaction of liquids and gases with surfaces defined by boundary conditions.With high-speed supercomputers, better solutions can be achieved. Ongoing research yields software that improves the accuracy and speed of complex simulation scenarios such as turbulent flows. Initial validation of such software is performed using a wind tunnel with the final validation coming in full-scale testing, e.g. flight tests.

      </p>
      <br>
      <b>Acoustical engineering
      </b>
      <p>Acoustical engineering is one of many other sub-disciplines of mechanical engineering and is the application of acoustics. Acoustical engineering is the study of Sound and Vibration. These engineers work effectively to reduce noise pollution in mechanical devices and in buildings by soundproofing or removing sources of unwanted noise. The study of acoustics can range from designing a more efficient hearing aid, microphone, headphone, or recording studio to enhancing the sound quality of an orchestra hall. Acoustical engineering also deals with the vibration of different mechanical systems.
